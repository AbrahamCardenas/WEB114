    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>Why is the JavaScript textContent property safer than innerHTML?</h2>
    <p>
      The textContent property is safer because it treats any incoming text for
      a user as only text, whereas the innerHTML will treat it as text and HTML,
      leading to a vulnerability where a user can insert HTML into the website.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain the relationship between an HTML attribute and a corresponding DOM
      property (explain the connection to JavaScript). Use a specific example in
      your answer
    </h2>
    <p>
      In short, an HTML attribute such as an id called "id='example'" can be
      directly changed by interacting with a property in the document object.
      This current example's equivalent would be
      "document.getElementById('example')" to target the element.
